-Install git

-Ensure you have installed a local server, Wamp or Xampp, or any other you are comfortable with.

-Clone the project from github into a preferred path..i.e. in Xampp, it's ####htdocs folder / Wamp, it's ####www folder, by doing this:
>Go to you github and copy the link address.
>In the htdocs or www folder, open a git Bash command and type down this command on the window: git clone <paste the link here...>

-Once it's done, launch the project. MAke sure your local server is running. On your browser enter localhost/onepageweb.com and Enter.
